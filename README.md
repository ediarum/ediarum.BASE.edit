## What does it do?

(http://www.oxygenxml.com). It is optimized for oXygen XML version 20.1. With the help of
ediarum.BASE.edit, scholars can create and edit TEI-XML based transcriptions of historical
documents. The transcriptions can be enriched in ediarum.BASE.edit with text critic, comments 
and links to an index. ediarum.BASE.edit is largely based on the TEI-XML subset "DTA Base 
format" of the German Text Archive.
